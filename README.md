## Planned
Nothing yet, feel free to suggest additions or changes!

## Potential issues
Of course, we can't ignore the amount of data requires to form these images.  
The main two things to worry about are performance losses and game updates 'patching' this feature (it is an exploit, after all).

## Contributing
I love suggestions! If you can think of anything to improve this application feel free to leave a suggestion on the discussion thread over at PlayStarbound (link pending).  
If you're really dedicated, you can also create a pull request and directly contribute to the mod!
